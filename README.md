Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that is used by many data science practitioners. In this training, we will learn about processing text data, working with imbalanced data and Poisson regression. We will start by learning about processing text data with scikit-learn's CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. Since the output of these vectorizers are sparse matrices, we will also review the scikit-learn estimators that can handle sparse input data. Next, we will learn about how to work with imbalanced data which appears in datasets where one of the classes appears more frequently than the others. Next, we will learn about generalized linear models with a focus on Poisson regression. Poisson regression is used to model target distributions that are counts or relative frequencies.  Lastly, we will learn how to use tree-based models such as Histogram-based Gradient Boosted Trees with a poisson loss to model relative frequencies.
